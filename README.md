# Implementing an Image Classifier using Deep Neural Networks

## Project Aim
The aim of this project is to build and train a deep neural network to classify images into different categories. The project involves creating a command-line application that allows users to train the model using `train.py` and make predictions using `predict.py`.

## Project Structure
- `train.py`: Script to train the deep neural network.
- `predict.py`: Script to make predictions using the trained model.

## How to Use

### Training the Model
To train the model, run the `train.py` script with the necessary arguments. For example:
```bash
python train.py --data_dir path/to/data --save_dir path/to/save_model --arch vgg16 --learning_rate 0.001 --hidden_units 512 --epochs 20
```
- `--data_dir`: Directory containing the training data.
- `--save_dir`: Directory to save the trained model.
- `--arch`: Model architecture (e.g., `vgg16`).
- `--learning_rate`: Learning rate for training.
- `--hidden_units`: Number of hidden units in the classifier.
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs.

### Making Predictions
To make predictions using the trained model, run the `predict.py` script with the necessary arguments. For example:
```bash
python predict.py --image_path path/to/image --checkpoint path/to/save_model/checkpoint.pth --top_k 5 --category_names cat_to_name.json
```
- `--image_path`: Path to the image file.
- `--checkpoint`: Path to the saved model checkpoint.
- `--top_k`: Number of top predictions to display.
- `--category_names`: JSON file mapping categories to real names.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- PIL

## Installation
Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy pillow
```

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to implement an image classifier using deep neural networks and provides a command-line interface for training and prediction. The scripts `train.py` and `predict.py` make it easy to train a model and use it for image classification tasks.

## Notebook Structure
The project also includes a Jupyter Notebook that provides an interactive environment for developing and testing the image classifier. The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the image data and apply necessary transformations.
2. **Model Architecture**: Define the deep neural network architecture.
3. **Training the Model**: Train the model using the training dataset.
4. **Validation**: Validate the model using the validation dataset.
5. **Testing**: Test the model's performance on the test dataset.
6. **Saving the Model**: Save the trained model for future use.
7. **Loading and Inference**: Load the saved model and make predictions on new images.
